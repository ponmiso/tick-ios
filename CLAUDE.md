This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is an iOS project called "tick-ios". The repository is currently empty and appears to be in initial setup phase.

## Development Setup
Once the iOS project is initialized, typical development commands will likely include:

- **Build**: Use Xcode to build the project, or `xcodebuild` from command line
- **Run**: Use Xcode simulator or device deployment
- **Test**: Use Xcode's test runner or `xcodebuild test` command

## Architecture Notes
The project structure will be established once the iOS project files are created. This will typically include:
- Xcode project/workspace files (.xcodeproj or .xcworkspace)
- Swift source files
- Storyboards/XIBs or SwiftUI views
- Asset catalogs
- Info.plist configuration

## Next Steps
This CLAUDE.md should be updated once the actual iOS project structure is in place to include:
- Specific build and test commands
- Project architecture and key components
- Development workflow and conventions
- Any custom scripts or build phases
